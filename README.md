# Haskell Turing Machine

This program is an example of how a Turing Machine can be implemented using a purely functional programming such as Haskell.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Since this is not a compiled binary, in order to run it on your machine you will have to install the Haskell Stack. There are several different compilers available but we recommend the one from the official Haskell website.

Download Here:
[Windows](http://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/install_and_upgrade/#windows)
[OSX](http://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/install_and_upgrade/#os-x)
[Linux](http://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/install_and_upgrade/#ubuntu)

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment
