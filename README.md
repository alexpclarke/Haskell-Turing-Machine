# Haskell Turing Machine

This program is an example of how a Turing Machine can be implemented using a purely functional programming such as Haskell.

## Background

### What it is

A Turing Machine is a mathematical model of computation used to define abstract machines. With the simple set of operations, these machines are able to model any computer algorythm. It is not always the most efficient method but a Turing Machine can do anything that you could do in popular programming languages such as Java. Since it's invention, there have still not been any machines that surpass a turing machine in terms of what problems it can solve.

### Where it came from

Prior to the invention of the Turing Machine, there were already several working computers in existance however these were always built to serve a specific purpose. When Alan Turing invented the Turing Machine in 1939, it was the first machine that could be programmed based on what the user wanted. While Turing never built a physical Turing Machine, the definition of the mathematical model allowed him to formalize what "computation" means and what it is possible to compute.

### How it works

A Turing Machine is comprised of four main components: a tape that is divided into discreet cells which can contain symbols; a head that can read and write to the tape; a state register; and a table that tells the head what to do based on the state register as well as the last read symbol. Although the tape is theoretically infinite, it will initially be set to the leftmost symol that is present and the initial state is determined by the input program.

## Prerequisites

### Haskell Compiler

Since this is not a compiled binary, in order to run it on your machine you will have to install the Haskell Stack. There are several different compilers available but we recommend the one from the official Haskell website.
