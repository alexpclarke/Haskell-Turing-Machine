# Haskell Turing Machine

This program is an example of how a Turing Machine can be implemented using a purely functional programming such as Haskell.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Since this is not a compiled binary, in order to run it on your machine you will have to install the Haskell Stack. There are several different compilers available but we recommend the one from the official Haskell website.
